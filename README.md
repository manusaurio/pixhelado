# Pixhelado
A raycaster based on a _digital differential analysis_ algorithm, written in Kotlin. Credit must be given to [Lode](https://lodev.org/) for [his tutorial in C++](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html), which I heavely relied on.

This project was one of the first things I did using Kotlin, and I never finished it (I might come back to it some time in the future.)

It requires Java 1.8 to run properly due to some weirdness about libgdx.
